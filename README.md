Volumetric Performance Toolbox
=====

> How can artists create new live performances during the time of COVID-19? Volumetric Performance Toolbox empowers creators to perform from their own living spaces for a virtual audience. Movement artist Valencia James performed publicly with the Toolbox for the first time on September 24, 2020 in the Mozilla Hubs virtual social space. The project is a collaboration between Valencia James, Glowbox and Sorob Louie as part of Eyebeamâ€™s Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future fellowship.

This is a fork of the Depthkit.js project, it demonstrates visualizing HLS stream of a custom video texture.
The custom texture is generate by this fork of AKVFX https://github.com/volumetricperformance/akvfx

# Depthkit.js
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/juniorxsound/DepthKit.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/juniorxsound/DepthKit.js)                [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

A plugin for visualising [Depthkit](http://www.depthkit.tv/) volumteric captures using [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) in WebGL. The plugin requires Three.js and a Depthkit *combined-per-pixel* video export.

![Depthkit.js screencapture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ScatterCo/DepthKit.js/master/assets/gh/banner.gif)

Include ```depthkit.js``` or ```depthkit.min.js``` after loading ```three.js``` in your project.

Alternatively, if you use Node.js you can install the package with npm using ```npm install depthkit``` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depthkit)

### Creating a character
```JavaScript
var depthkit = new Depthkit();
depthkit.load(
	"myClip.txt",
	"myClip.mp4",
	character => {
		scene.add(character);
	}
);
```
Where the first and second arguments are the path to the metadata file and the *combined-per-pixel* video exported by Depthkit.
The third argument is a callback that is passed a THREE.Object3D object representing the Depthkit character.

### Controlling a character
Calling ```new DepthKit()``` returns an object that has the neccesery methods to control the playback and rendering of the character

```depthkit.play()``` - Play the video

```depthkit.pause()``` - Pause the video

```depthkit.stop()``` - Stop and rewind to begining

```depthkit.setLoop(isLooping)``` - Set loop to true or false

```depthkit.setVolume(volume)``` - Change the volume of the audio

```depthkit.setOpacity(opacity)``` - Change opacity

```depthkit.dispose()```
- Dispose and clean the character instance

## How to contribute:
1. Fork/Clone/Download
1. Install all dependcies using ```npm install```
1. Use the following node commands:

```npm run start``` uses ```concurrently``` to start an ```http-server``` and to run ```watchify``` and bundle on every change to ```build/depthkit.js```

```npm run build``` to bundle and minify to ```build/depthkit.min.js```
